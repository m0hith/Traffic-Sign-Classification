# Traffic-Sign-Classification

Emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence play a vital role in the industry of automation. Automobile industry in particular has a very important connection with AI and Deep learning. Multinational companies like Tesla, Uber, Google, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, etc are working on autonomous vehicles and self-driving cars. One of the key aspects to this technology, is that the vehicles should be able to interpret traffic signs and make decisions accordingly. There are various classifications of traffic signs like speed limits, no entry, turn left or right, children crossing, no passing of heavy vehicles, etc. This project is intended to build a convolutional neural network model that can classify images of traffic sign boards into different categories.

### Dataset:
The German Traffic Sign Benchmark is a multi-class, single-image classification challenge held at the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2011. We cordially invite researchers from relevant fields to participate: The competition is designed to allow for participation without special domain knowledge. Our benchmark has the following properties:
- Single-image, multi-class classification problem
- More than 40 classes
- More than 50,000 images in total
- Large, lifelike database
